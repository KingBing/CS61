>Description</H2
><P
>	The <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sys_futex</CODE
> system call provides a method for
	a program to wait for a value at a given address to change, and a
	method to wake up anyone waiting on a particular address. While the
	addresses for the same memory in separate processes may not be
	identical, the kernel maps them interally so the same memory mapped in
	different locations will correspond for
	<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sys_futex</CODE
> calls.  Futexes are typically used to
	implement the contended case of a lock in shared memory, as
	described in
	<SPAN
CLASS="CITEREFENTRY"
><SPAN
CLASS="REFENTRYTITLE"
>futex</SPAN
>(4)</SPAN
>.
    </P
><P
>      When a 
      <SPAN
CLASS="CITEREFENTRY"
><SPAN
CLASS="REFENTRYTITLE"
>futex</SPAN
>(4)</SPAN
>
      operation does not finish uncontended in userspace, a call needs to be made to the kernel
      to arbitrate. Arbitration can either mean putting the calling process to sleep or, conversely, 
      waking a waiting process.
    </P
><P
>      Callers of this function are expected to adhere to the semantics as set out in
      <SPAN
CLASS="CITEREFENTRY"
><SPAN
CLASS="REFENTRYTITLE"
>futex</SPAN
>(4)</SPAN
>. As these
      semantics involve writing non-portable assembly instructions, this in turn
      probably means that most users will in fact be library authors and not general application developers.
    </P
><P
>      The <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>futex</VAR
> and <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>futex2</VAR
> arguments need to point at aligned 32 bit integers which store 
      the counter. The operation to execute is passed via the <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>op</VAR
> parameter, along with a value <VAR
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>val</VAR
>.
    </P
><P
>      Because of historical reasons, the futex system call is highly overloaded. The <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sys_futex</CODE
> prototype is the canonical
      invocation, while <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sys_futex1</CODE
> was the original implementation. It should be noted that there is but one system call,
      only the number of the parameters and their names differ.

CLASS="PARAMETER"
>timeout</VAR

	      of the wait, which is infinite otherwise.  For <SPAN

>      To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an easy to use abstraction for end-users. Implementors
      are expected to be assembly literate and to have read the sources of the futex userspace library referenced
      below.

      Current semantics are available from Linux 2.5.40 onwards, FUTEX_REQUEUE was added around 2.5.70, whilst 
      FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE was added in 2.6.7.
